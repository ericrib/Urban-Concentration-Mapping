# Urban-Concentration-Mapping
Urban concentration heat maps extracted from Google Maps Aerial Images.

### Objective
This project proposes spatial analisys of urban areas given aerial images, with focus on building and populational density. The main goal is to extract heat maps that describe urban concentration and provide  data for geospatial studies.

### Image Processing Methods
[yet to be  better defined and improved]  
Computer vison methods for extraction of characteristics based on espectral indexes and regression analisys for density estimation.

### Aplication
Designed to aid spatial epidemiology projects, but useful to other geospatial studies and public interests.
